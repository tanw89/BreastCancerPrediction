#Breast Cancer Prediction

For my project, I played around with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The target is to classify the nature of the tumour (malignant or benign) using the features in the dataset, such as radius, symmetry, area, and a host of other parameters. As this was a classification problem, I tried several techniques including

1. Logistic Regression
2. PCA
3. Feedforward Neural Network in Keras
4. XGBoost classifier
