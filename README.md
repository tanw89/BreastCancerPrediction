**Breast Cancer Prediction**

For my project, I played around with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The target is to classify the nature of the tumour (malignant or benign) using the features in the dataset, such as radius, symmetry, area, and a host of other parameters. As this was a classification problem, I tried several techniques including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Principal Component Analysis
3. Feedforward Neural Network in Keras
4. K-Nearest Neighbours
5. XGBoost classifier

This is a relatively simple dataset as the correlations were already very high even with very few features. I will try to play around with a more difficult dataset sometime -- this will serve as an exploration of the different techniques and getting used to their syntax.

Have fun reading!
